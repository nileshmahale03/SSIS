Softwares:
1. Visual Studio - BIDS(2005, 2008, 2008R2)/SSDT(2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019)
2. SQL Server Management Studio - For administration and scheduling on SSIS

SSIS is an ETL/ELT tool. 
Extract   = Pull data out of one or more sources i.e. CRM, Sales, HR, Finance etc..
Transform = Apply business rules to the data. 
Load      = Send the final resulting data into a one common destination. 

Why SSIS?
1. Data Source Integration e.g. SQL Server, Oracle, .CSV, Excel 
2. Data Warehouse Ready
3. Data Cleansing - correcting bad data

SSIS use cases:
1. Data Flow - SCD: I need to load a data warehouse dimension table without duplicating data each time I run the load.
2. Data Flow - FTP: I need to download and load files from an FTP server. 
3. Data Flow - DQS: I have data quality problems when load state data from Customers (CA, ca, California)

Job Duties:
1. In charge of the overall data warehouse design
2. Develops the data loading process
3. Reposnsible for data cleansing and accuracy
4. Create analytical layer that business users interact with
5. Designs reports based on business user specification
6. Write formulas to store necessary calculations for the business
7. Create report delivery mechanisms to send report directly to users

Basic Terminology:
1. Package
   - The unit of work for SSIS. 
   - Any development done in SSIS is within what's known as a package.
2. Connection Manager
   - Stores the connection string information for your sources and destinations that will be used in a package.
3. Control Flow
   - The component of SSIS packages that controls the order of operations and flow of a package. 
   - There can be only one of these per package.
4. Tasks
   - These tells SSIS what operations to perform in the Control Flow. 
5. Precedence Constraints
   - A part of the Control Flow that directs movement between multiple Control Flow Tasks. 
   - Success, Failure, Completion 
   - AND/OR Operations
6. Containers
   - Can be used for organizing elements of a package.
   - Some containers have the ability to loop or iterate over control flow tasks. 
7. Data Flow
   - This is one specific Task that coordinates data movement and transformations. 
   - This is generally where most ETL/ELT work is done. 
8. Transformations
   - Within a Data Flow transforms allow you to apply business rules to your data prior to loading it into a destination.
9. Event Handler
   - Component of SSIS that allows you to control what happens in the event of an error.

		- 8. Lookup
			1. Similar to SQL join

		- 9. Merge
			1. Similar to Union All but sorted 
		- 10. Merge Join
			1. Similar to FULL, LEFT, or INNER join.

	- 2. Fixed width
	- 3. Fixed width with row delimiters
	- 4. Ragged right

5. SSIS Variables
	- Breakpoint
	- Watch

6. SSIS Parameters
	- 1. SQL Parameters (?)
	- 2. Package Parameters
	- 3. Project Parameters

7. SSIS Expressions

	- 2. Connections - Change connection string dynamically. 
	- 3. Variables - Change a Variable Output dynamically.
	- 4. Precedence Constraints - Change the Constraint Direction dynamically.
	- 5. Data Flow - e.g. Conditional Split, Derived Column 

8. Loading a Dimension Table
	- 1. Decision Point
		- is this new row?
		- is this row an update?
		- is this row a duplicate?
	- 2. Column Type
		- Type 0
		- Type 1
		- Type 2
	- 3. SCD Wizard
		- + point
			- faster development
			- customizable 
		- Weaknesses
			- Maintenance
			- Speed (OLE DB commnd is row by row operation)
			- Scalability
	- 4. Late arriving dimension 
		- Inferred dimension member: used when a fact table may reference dimension members
		                             that are not yet loaded. 
	
9. Loading a Fact Table
	- all the dimensions all loaded first then we load the fact tables since we have lookup against dimensions
	- retrieve the surrogate key from each dimension during a fact load using Lookup
	- handle rows with no matching entries in the SSIS Lookup transform using Ignore Failure
	- replace NULL surrogate key values with -1 using Derived Column
	- Error: cannot map the input column to the lookup column because the data types do not match
	- Resolution: Open the Flat File Connection Manager -> Go To Advanced Tab -> Click on the Column and change the Data Type from DT_STR to DT_WSTR

10. Troubleshooting SSIS 
	- 1. Adding Data Viewer -> pause the progress of the data flow and allow you to view the data and validate transformation logic
	- 2. Using Breakpoint - pause an SSIS package and evaluate variable values
	- 3. Debug -> Watch 
	- 4. Debug -> Locals 
	- 3. Execution Results Tab -> Finding Error Messages
	- 4. Enabling Error Output in Data Flow Tasks

		- SSIS Catalog : Deploy entire project instead of individual packages 
		  SSIS DB        2016 and above- Can also Deploy individual packages while still using a project deployment model 
						 All SSIS objects are stored in SQL Server
						 Each instance of SQL Server can have only ONE Catalog 
						 Project Versioning built-in

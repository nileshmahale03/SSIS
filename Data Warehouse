Data Warehouse:
1. Why not report from Transactional System?
	- 1. Designed for INSERT/UPDATE
	- 2. Getting required report data may involve multiple joins i.e. lengthy queries
	- 3. Usually dosen't store history 
	- 4. Reporting on this database can slow down the application it is used for
	
2. Why build a Data Warehouse?
	- 1. Optimized Reporting
	- 2. Archival of Data
	- 3. Consolidation of Data
	
3. Dimensional Model
	- 1. Highly Denormalized - Table merged logically for reporting
	- 2. Table Types - Fact and Dimension Tables 
	- 3. Only fields Needed for Reporting 
	
4. Dimension Table
	- 1. Answer WHERE clause
	- 2. Wide Tables 
	- 3. Contain Surrogate Key 

5. Fact Table
	- 1. Stored Metric Data
	- 2. Relationships - Fact tables intersect dimensions
	- 3. Types: 
		- 1. Transactional
		- 2. Periodic snapshot
		- 3. Accumulating snapshot
	- Surrogate keys, not business keys (alternate keys), are stored in the fact tables.
	
6. Surrogate Keys

7. Dimension Types
	- 1. Type 0: Fixed, non changing 
	- 2. Type 1: Changing attribute, no history kept
	- 3. Type 2: Changing attribute, keeps historical changes
	
8. Star Schema

9. Snowflake Schema
